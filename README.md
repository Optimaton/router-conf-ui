Sample UI Page for Web Configuration Page

This is a sample for router configuration page.
The focus here is on minimalistic UI without cluttering the screen and also enchancing user-experience with just jquery.

TODO:
1. Make it functional in nature
2. Incorporate newer frameworks like reactjs, angularjs for enhanced UX.
